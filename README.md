ViSTran: Visualizing chromatin State Transitions

`data_visualization`
directory contains the static code for the bipartite graph. I used AngularJS and d3.js to develop the visualization. The tool is designed to take two inputs: i) the chromatin state annotation files for the two states and ii) genomic region of interests (ie. promoter, enhancers etc.). The web tool then renders the results as bipartite graph showing the state transitions between conditions.
